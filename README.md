# Finding Short Cycles in Private Networks

This is the code I used to test the algorithm as described in my thesis[^1].
Paper is WIP.

## User instructions

### Requirements

To run the experiments, ensure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) version 8 or newer installed.
On Linux systems that use `apt` (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu), you can install these programs with

```shell
sudo apt install -y cmake make gcc
```

To plot the experiments, ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.10 or newer installed.
You can then install the Python packages with

```shell
pip install .
```

As usual for Python, it is recommended that you do so inside a [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#create-and-use-virtual-environments).

### Usage

To compile and run the experiments, execute the commands

```shell
cmake .
make
./cycle_detection_experiments
```

Results are written to the directory `out/`.
Each time you re-run the experiments, a separate log file is written to `out/`.

To plot the results contained in `<filename.log>`, run (inside your virtualenv, if you created one)
```shell
cd src/
python3 -m plotcreator <filename.log>
```

To automatically select the most recent file in `out/`, run (inside your virtualenv, if you created one)
```shell
cd src/
python3 -m plotcreator "$(find ../out/ -type f -printf "%T@ %p\n" | sort -n | cut -d' ' -f 2- | tail -n 1)"
```

Figures are stored in `out/fig/`.

### Inspecting published results
If you want to inspect the outputs generated by the authors for the paper without running the experiments yourself, you can download the pre-generated results from [4TU.ResearchData](https://doi.org/10.4121/d23e6d7d-15d9-4c83-86de-5a3fc1fd5aa6.v1).
Download the file `bounded-private-cycle-detection.out.zip` and extract it so that the directory `out/` is in the same directory as this `README.md` file.
The directory `out/` should itself contain the directory `log/`, which contains the `.csv` file describing the experiments' outputs.
You can then either inspect that `.csv` file manually, or you can run (inside your virtualenv, if you created one)
```shell
cd src/
python3 -m plotcreator ../out/log/all-results.log
```
to generate the plots seen in the paper, and store them in `out/fig/`.
